# ML-Project
I developed a web application that utilizes Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict Covid-19 from chest X-ray images. The application allows users to upload an image for classification. For the image classification, I used a CNN model and implemented it using Python. I also used Flask to develop the web application.
